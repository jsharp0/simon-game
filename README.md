# simon-game
This file is an online version of the popular Simon game that challenges users to repeat a color pattern of increasing length. It was an exercise of my ability to work with jQuery and Javascript, and ultimately I feel like it taught me a lot. 

## How to Play
To start the game, press any key on your keyboard. The game will create a new sequence starting with one color, and will add a new item to the sequence each time you correctly click the pattern. There is no level limit.
